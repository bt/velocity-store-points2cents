# Velocity Store - Points to Cents

This is a Tampermonkey script for Google Chrome (and potentially Firefox using Greasemonkey; but untested) to add "Australian Dollar values" to the Velocity Rewards Store.

# But, how do you calculate the value?

Currently, the script is hardcoded with a value of $0.014/point; we then extract the points value from the store and multiply by this cent/point value. This value is the average of how much people are "gifting" points to each other on various Australian forums.

# Sounds cool, what does it look like?

Here's a screenshot:

# Why did you even make this?

Well, I received this email for my birthday from Virgin Australia/Velocity:

Sweet! I got tons of points, why not get myself an Apple iPhone 256GB XS?!
